<h3 align="center">When my notebook began to grow from a large number of passwords, I decided that it was time to make password storage more modern. I could use one of the many existing ones, but why not try to do it myself?ðŸ˜‰ It took me only 2 days to develop, the application can save and issue passwords, and also has a small encryption system. The encryption system is not perfect, but at least it will help to keep your passwords from prying eyes.</h3>
<p>For development, I used libraries preinstalled in Python. Tkinter was used to create the graphical interface</p>
